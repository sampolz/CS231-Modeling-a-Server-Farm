# CS231-Modeling-a-Server-Farm
Modeling a server farm using Queues in Java

This project modeled a virtual server farm, taking in jobs and completion times. It then assigned the jobs to different servers using different strategies to find the most efficient algorithm. The goal of this project was to learn about queues.

**Code for this project can be seen in master**
